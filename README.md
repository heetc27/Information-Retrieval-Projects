# CSE 535: Information-Retrieval

## Information Retrieval Academic Projects in the Computer Science Graduate Program at University at Buffalo

Description:

This course will introduce students to text-based information retrieval (IR) techniques, i.e. search engines. The
course begins with the fundamentals of processing large-scale, multilingual text document collections. Various IR
models such as the Boolean model, vector space model, and probabilistic models will be studied. Efficient indexing
techniques for (i) general document collections, (ii) specialized collections (e.g. Wikipedia, biomedical, patents) and
(iii) high velocity data such as social media will be discussed. Techniques for improving search efficiency, improving
performance as well as evaluation methodology will be covered. The latter part of the course will focus on web
search including link analysis techniques such as PageRank and HITS. The use of word vectors (Word2vec, GloVe)
generated through neural models and their use in IR systems will be introduced. Students will work on
programming projects (implemented on the AWS cloud computing platform) to gain hands-on expertise in building
IR systems. This course provides the foundation for the follow-on course (CSE 635) which discusses natural language
processing (NLP) and deeper text mining solutions.

Prerequisites: Programming expertise in Python, Linear Algebra
